# Applied Anonymous Utilization of Access-Controlled Services
__Authors__: Max Hartman, Aspyn Palatnick  
__Date__: Spring 2020

## Abstract
We present an application for anonymous users to interact with a server after verifying the membership of each user in a certain group, such as an institution or organization. Existing systems may offer peer-to-peer anonymity but frequently require non-anonymous accounts. This implementation will take the form of an anonymous-authentication system that can be integrated into applications that desire anonymous-authentication. The complete project will result in a functional web app forum allowing students at the University of Pennsylvania to interact anonymously while being certain that every individual present has university-authorized credentials.

## Project Objectives
Our project intends to address the question of how to create an online service that ensures all users are authenticated by a particular authentication ser- vice while preserving anonymity. We want to guarantee that all interactions with the online ser- vice, such as users uploading posts on a forum, are anonymous. Moreover, the server provides each user with a set of specific possible actions but leaks no information regarding actions a user has taken. With these goals in mind, our target objectives are as follows:
1. Architect an anonymous-authentication sys- tem and show the efficacy of the model
2. Implement a functional prototype of the anonymous-authentication system
3. Demonstrate the effectiveness in practice of the system
